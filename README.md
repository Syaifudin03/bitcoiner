# 🤖 Bitcoiner - A Friendly In-development Bitcoin Bot for Messenger

Facebook recently opened up their Messenger platform to enable bots to converse with users through Facebook Apps and on Facebook Pages. I decided to toy around with the API. If you would like to see additional functions, queries, etc., please open a new Issue with your request.

*Bitcoiner can only respond to approved users until approved by Facebook*

You can read the  [documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) here to make your own bot.

## What I can do
##### Updated 04/18/2016

* Echo recieved text back for testing.
* Present 15 minute average price of XBTC in USD.
  * Listens for any `String` with `Price`; any `String` with combination of `current` and `rate`

## Conversations I would like to have with you soon

* What is the most recent block?
* How many times has `TXID` been confirmed?
* What's my current balance?
  * Triggures you to save a XBTC wallet address
  * Optional Statement: Whats the balance of `address`?
* How has the week been?

*Open a Issue for other functions you would like to see.*
